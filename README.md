# Animate GIF Project
## Abby Fischler, Jenelle Liu, and Abigail Han

For our Adv. Intro to Comp. Sci.: Computer Programming we were instructed to using [Processing](https://processing.org/) to build an animated GIF. We were inspired by the popular game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) to make a GIF of people attempting to solve a wordle. Our animated GIF shows different ways to get to a word. We designed the boards in Figma.

To run open the project in processing!

Please submit a PR with any changes / suggestions! Thank you to Dr. Spell for his help with this project.
